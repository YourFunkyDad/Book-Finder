My brain is fully scrambled. I am not well versed in GraphQL. But my issue currently seems to be connecting to the Apollo Server. 

Error 1 occurs when the entire "routes" folder is commented out. I feel like I am on the right path this way, but my API is messing up somewhere.

Error 2 happens when I leave my "routes" folder alone.

Unfortunately I no longer have a Tutor that I can ask for assistance, but I am needing to turn something in to show I am consistently working on my homework. 
Hopefully someone can share some insight as I am going in circles.
